SCore

Package score.money was used by me in a Java/Scala project as a fixed-point currency library for financial calculations, alternative to BigDecimal and Double, because: 
1) consume 2 times less memory, for high volume of data - 128-bit (16-byte, implemented as 4-int inside); 
2) interoperable with standard Java/Scala numeric entities; 
3) precision and rounding mode were carefully selected;
4) Scala statically checks consistency of some expressions: 
Amount(4500) + Amount(4500) * Percent(80) - correct
Percent(80) * Percent(80) - not allowed.

TODO
- consistency checks must operate as "assertion" methods called on a final expression;
- use Scala 2.10 macros in addition to implicits, for compile-time consistency checks;
- more unit tests.
