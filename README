SCore

Stuff used by me in Java/Scala projects, which makes sense as separate library

Contains:
- score.money is Scala fixed-point currency library, which is used as alternative to BigDecimal and Double in financial calculations, because: a) consume less memory - 128-bit (16-byte, implemented as 4-int inside); b) still interoperable with standard Java/Scala numeric entities, and c) Scala statically checks consistency of expressions: (Amount(0.50) + Amount(4.2)) * Percent(80)
