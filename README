Stuff used by me in Java/Scala projects, which makes sense as separate library

Notably:
- score.money.{Amount, Coef, Percent} are fixed point BigDecimal-like classes, used in financial calculations for the sake of correctness and easy interoperability with Java/Scala standard numeric entities. Their size is 128 bit, accuracy is (19, 18), and Scala statically checks consistency of formulas like this: (Amount(0.50) + Amount(4.2)) * Percent(80)
